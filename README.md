# Java-Programs
Only programs written in Java.
Each branch is is a single program. Look for the branch by the name of the program you are looking for.
Also, don't release my work to the public without giving me credit; you don't even need to put it in a bibliography:
just say something like "Lines ___ to ___ were copied from ___ by 5b-name-5d," or "5b-name-5d wrote that program."
I want to keep this stuff open to as many people as possible, and as of 12/15/15, barely anybody looks at my programs,
but I like to receive credit for my work.
